##### Comments:
Again, I really like React. I am so ready to learn my way through all the nooks and crannies of the entire thing, I am enticed. A bit bittersweet, as it is the last workshop I'll be doing for SheCodes. I learned so much, what amagical place. Now, I'm a front-end developer. So sick. Note to self: *You did it again. Well done! I'm so proud of you.*.

##### Skills acquired:
* React.js
* Node.js
* npm
* API intergration
* The use of the terminal
